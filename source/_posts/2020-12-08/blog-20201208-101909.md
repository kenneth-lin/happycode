[How to start an application using android ADB tools?](/questions/4567904/how-to-start-an-application-using-android-adb-tools) (11 answers)

Closed 3 years ago.

From the post [Is it possible to start activity through adb shell?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13380590/is-it-possible-to-start-activity-through-adb-shell), we can start an Android app via adb by

    adb shell am start -n yourpackagename/.activityname
    

But is it possible to start an Android app via adb without knowing the Activity name? For example, by sending the **android.intent.action.MAIN** intent to a package? Maybe some command like this:

    adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -n packageName
    

Thanks!!

    @AlexP. But this question is not quite the same—— At least, Google "adb start app" result in lots of `adb shell am start -n packagename/.activityname` things; while Google "adb start app **without knowing Activity name**" won't filter out the duplicated SO question. So this question could be reasonably valuable. – [Weekend](/users/1819810/weekend "1,341 reputation") Aug 29 '18 at 2:38

    The duplicated question accidentally has an answer which solves this question. But it's not the duplicated question specifically asked for. This question is asking for a more particular situation. – [Weekend](/users/1819810/weekend "1,341 reputation") Aug 29 '18 at 2:50

Yes, it is possible to launch an app via adb shell making use of the monkey tool.

Using the command from [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4567904/how-to-start-an-application-using-android-adb-tools/25398877#25398877):

    adb shell monkey -p app.package.name -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
    

This command simulates the app icon click, so the intent implicit intent LAUNCHER is delivered to the specific receiver declared in app manifest (MAIN)

*   It worked. But how to detect Main Activity name? I want to send parameter to a activity (main activity in com.sec.android.gallery3d package), So I should know main activity name. – [Dr.jacky](/users/421467/dr-jacky "2,306 reputation") Dec 15 '15 at 8:17
    
*   Is it also possible, given the APK file, to run this ? Suppose I have an APK file, and I want to be able to install&run it, is it possible? – [android developer](/users/878126/android-developer "105,349 reputation") Jun 15 '16 at 7:41

    @IgorGanapolsky, are you sure the package name is correct? If you're the developer of the application, make sure you have at least one activity with the intent filter with action `android.intent.action.MAIN` and category `android.intent.category.LAUNCHER` – [Leuofiridia](/users/1648969/leuofiridia "1,031 reputation") Aug 9 '16 at 21:06
    
*   @androiddeveloper yes, it's possible. Android Studio itself use the adb to install and run the app when you click to run the file. Take a look at [the official adb documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#move) for further details – [Leuofiridia](/users/1648969/leuofiridia "1,031 reputation") Aug 9 '16 at 21:12

Using latest versions (at least API 25) you can start the default Activity, without knowing its name, and not using `monkey`:

    PKG=com.android.calculator2
    adb shell am start $PKG/$(adb shell cmd package resolve-activity -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER $PKG | sed -n '/name=/s/^.*name=//p')

*   I don't like nitpicking much but it is not _starting the default Activity, without knowing its name_ - it's just _finding the default Activity first, then using it_. Also there is no need to run `cmd package` in a separate `adb shell` session - it could be run in the same shell as `am start`. As a bonus the command will be more OS agnostic (currently it requires some unix shell to process the substitution). Finally, `cmd package resolve-activity` command has a `--brief` parameter which would print the full name of the default activity (as the last line) even without specifying the category. – [Alex P.](/users/1778421/alex-p "25,891 reputation") Dec 24 '16 at 21:32

    `adb shell 'am start $(cmd package resolve-activity --brief com.google.android.calculator | tail -n 1)'` - for Windows replace `'` with `"` – [Alex P.](/users/1778421/alex-p "25,891 reputation") Dec 24 '16 at 21:38

If you have the apk file, you can install and start the app using [droidbot](https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot).

    > droidbot -d emulator-5554 -a <xxx.apk> -install_app -policy none -count 0
    

DroidBot is based on adb, but it uses static analysis to extract the Activity name automatically.
